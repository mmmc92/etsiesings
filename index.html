    <div class="bio">
      <p>Etsie is a musician based out of Garden City, MI.
        They were born in Ann Arbor, and lived for several years in Chicago, IL and Lansing, MI.
        Lansing was the first place they saw regular people happily building music careers, and
        where they fell in love with the idea of touring. Raised in a musical household, and
        receiving scattered spontaneous vocal training through Musical Theater, Etsie is a largely
        self-taught musician who is learning by doing, and by connecting with musicians they admire.
        While guitar is their main instrument, Etsie enjoys exploring new skills and is proficient in
        multiple instruments including ukulele, piano, and harmonica. As an autistic and ADHD artist,
        they are never satisfied with one focus, and feel constantly drawn to improve their craft and
        their scope of knowledge. Etsie has also struggled to feel close to peers at many points in their
        life, and enjoys the freedom of expression as well as the close connection to others that music
        affords them. Their musical influence is comprised largely of indie folk artists, including Hozier,
        Conor Oberst, Phoebe Bridgers, and the Decemberists. Etsie is currently working on producing their
        first full length album, which they are recording out of a small room in their basement with
        carpeted walls. Etsie plays locally at farmers markets and coffee shops around southeastern
        Michigan, and they aspire soon to plan a short tour around the Midwest to promote their album
        when it is finished.
